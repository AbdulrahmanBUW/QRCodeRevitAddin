# Icon Placeholder

This folder should contain a 32x32 PNG icon named "qr-icon-32.png" for the ribbon buttons.

You can:
1. Create a simple QR code icon using any graphics tool
2. Use an existing QR code image scaled to 32x32 pixels
3. Or the add-in will work without the icon (buttons will have text only)

Recommended icon properties:
- Size: 32x32 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Content: Simple QR code representation or square grid pattern
